## Security Best Practices for Users

### 🔐 Deployment Security

**SonarQube Token Management:**
```bash
# Generate a dedicated token for MCP integration
# Use minimal required permissions
# Rotate tokens regularly
# Store securely using Docker secrets or environment variables
```

**Environment Configuration:**
```bash
# Use strong, unique passwords
bash docker/scripts/manage-secrets.sh generate

# Validate configuration before deployment
bash docker/scripts/validate-config.sh docker/environments/.env.production

# Enable HTTPS in production
HTTPS_ONLY=true
SECURE_COOKIES=true
SSL_VERIFY_PEER=true
```

**Network Security:**
```bash
# Restrict network access
# Use firewall rules to limit exposure
# Enable rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=100

# Configure security headers
SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=true
CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY=default-src 'self'
```

### 🛡️ Operational Security

**Regular Maintenance:**
- Keep Docker images updated
- Apply security patches promptly
- Monitor security advisories
- Review access logs regularly
- Backup data securely with encryption

**Monitoring and Alerting:**
- Enable audit logging
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Set up security alerts
- Regular security assessments
- Incident response procedures

**Access Control:**
- Principle of least privilege
